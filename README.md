JSTestClient
============

Javascript tool to test funtionality of the ask app services.

We use Qunit for the Unit test framework. 

Take the Timeout project as a example here. 
1 test_timeout.html (file  that you display the test report generated by Qunit) 
2 test_tiemout.js (file that contains the test cases .)

Broswer the test_timeout.html to run the test.
